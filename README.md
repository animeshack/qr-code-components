## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
Using percentage helped realized that a page becomes more responsive than using pixels as size.

```css
  .container{
      width: 80%;
  }   
  .qr-code{
      width: 100%;
    }
```

### Continued development

I would like to focus on more css-grid in the future, didn't realised css grid is such a powerful framework until now. Planning to be Pro at Front-end soon
